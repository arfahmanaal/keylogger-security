# keylogger-security
A Python keylogger is a  script that runs in the background and records every keystroke on a computer. The script typically involves using Python libraries to capture keyboard events and log them into a file or send them to a remote server for analysis. It's crucial to use such tools responsibly and within legal boundaries.
